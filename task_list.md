## Update

### Card Generation
I decided to ignore generating balanced logical card for now, and just make random ones with no patterns instead, this is to be able to advance the project faster, once the basic play mechanic will be working, then ill just go back to adjusting the generation process and fix it 🔨.

### New Philosophy
💋 K.I.S (Keep it simple stupid, a new script will be made and added, following this philosophy, the current script will be kept as a backup reference to some idea.)
